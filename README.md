My process of setup, assumptions, file structure and thought process while designing is documented in the file Nandita_Documentation_Solace_Assignment_Groundup.pdf

Steps to setup/run the code:
1. Set AWS configure with repective key and passwords
2. Clone the repo to you local
3. Once all the files are in place, run the command "python cli.py apply config.json"
4. Resources specified in the config.json will be applied to you AWS account
